We invite the submission of extended abstracts on work that has been published already, novel unpublished work, or work in progress.
More specifically, the following forms of submissions are solicited:

-Proposals for short tutorial presentations on topics related to the workshop. Tutorial proposals will be reviewed by the PC. The number of accepted tutorials depends on the overall number of accepted papers and talks, with the aim to set up a balanced workshop program.

-Talk abstracts reporting on already published work. Such an abstract should include an outline of the planned talk, and pointers to relevant bibliography.

-Talk proposals presenting work that is unpublished or in progress.

-Submissions which describe novel applications of QBF or related formalisms in various domains are particularly welcome. Additionally, this call comprises known applications which have been shown to be hard for QBF solvers in the past as well as new applications for which present QBF solvers might lack certain features still to be identified.

Submissions must be prepared in English. There is no mandatory format. Authors can choose any reasonable format for their submissions.
Plans for dissemination:
The outcomes of the discussions will be summarized in a workshop report, which will be made publicly available as a technical report. Extended abstracts of the talks will also be included in the technical report.
