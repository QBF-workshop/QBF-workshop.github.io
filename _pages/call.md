The workshop is concerned with all aspects of current research on all formalisms enriched by quantifiers, and in particular QBF. The topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Applications, encodings and benchmarks with quantifiers 
- QBF Proof theory and complexity results 
- Experimental evaluations of solvers or related tools 
- Case studies illustrating the power of quantifiers 
- Certificates and proofs for QBF, QCSP, SMT with quantifiers, etc. 
- Formats of proofs and certificates 
- Implementations of proof checkers and verifiers 
- Decision procedures 
- Calculi and their relationships 
- Data structures, implementation details and heuristics 
- Pre- and inprocessing techniques 
- Structural reasoning
